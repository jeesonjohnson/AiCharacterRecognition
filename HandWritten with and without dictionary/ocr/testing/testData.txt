Hello my name is jeeson johnson this document is being written to act as testing data for the models that have been created for the artificial intelligence coursework which has implemented numerous artificial intelligence models this document is written by hand and then scanned onto the computer as a png file which can then be translated and manipulated by software that extracts the associated characters the characters are then fed into the trained model which can then make a prediction which can then be used to calculate appropriate metrics about the models that were created we can then compare the effects of using this testing dataset on models and contrast them between each other artificial intelligence is a very promising field that will have a huge effect on our future as artificial intelligence is incorporated into older industries.
