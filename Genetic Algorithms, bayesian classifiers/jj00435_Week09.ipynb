      "> INTRODUCTION\n",
      ">\n",
      "> THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and\n",
      "> totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of\n",
      "> freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom,\n",
      "> democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only\n",
      "> nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and\n",
      "> guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the\n",
      "> potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People\n",
      "> everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them;\n",
      "> worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own\n",
      "> property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom\n",
      "> are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of\n",
      "> protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of\n",
      "> freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military\n",
      "> strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our\n",
      "> heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for\n",
      "> unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that\n",
      "> favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies\n",
      "> can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and\n",
      "> economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the\n",
      "> world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace\n",
      "> against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace\n",
      "> by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the\n",
      "> peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental\n",
      "> commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed\n",
      "> dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great\n",
      "> industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of\n",
      "> individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less\n",
      "> than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to\n",
      "> penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies\n",
      "> against us.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal --\n",
      "> from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and\n",
      "> cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global\n",
      "> reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help\n",
      "> nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will\n",
      "> hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the\n",
      "> allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and\n",
      "> countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop\n",
      "> new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every\n",
      "> turn.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism\n",
      "> and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking\n",
      "> weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing\n",
      "> so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to\n",
      "> succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other\n",
      "> means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny,\n",
      "> contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous\n",
      "> technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America\n",
      "> will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We\n",
      "> cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must\n",
      "> be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence\n",
      "> and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who\n",
      "> saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have\n",
      "> entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic\n",
      "> opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community\n",
      "> has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the\n",
      "> seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace\n",
      "> instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers\n",
      "> find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist\n",
      "> violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common\n",
      "> interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by\n",
      "> common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching\n",
      "> for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese\n",
      "> leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of\n",
      "> national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political\n",
      "> freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage\n",
      "> the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations,\n",
      "> because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and\n",
      "> international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great\n",
      "> powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity,\n",
      "> trade, and cultural advancement.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend\n",
      "> the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring\n",
      "> the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to\n",
      "> every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us\n",
      "> that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our\n",
      "> national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people\n",
      "> into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and\n",
      "> corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and\n",
      "> drug cartels within their borders.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a\n",
      "> better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free\n",
      "> trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies\n",
      "> out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual\n",
      "> nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to\n",
      "> build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity.\n",
      "> The United States will deliver greater development assistance through\n",
      "> the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly,\n",
      "> invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also\n",
      "> continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of\n",
      "> AIDS and other infectious diseases.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is\n",
      "> guided by the conviction that all nations have important\n",
      "> responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror.\n",
      "> Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the\n",
      "> spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international\n",
      "> aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For\n",
      "> freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer,\n",
      "> better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply\n",
      "> the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed\n",
      "> to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade\n",
      "> Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as\n",
      "> other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment\n",
      "> these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations\n",
      "> are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to\n",
      "> rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of\n",
      "> every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has\n",
      "> been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the\n",
      "> clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and\n",
      "> it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity\n",
      "> holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all\n",
      "> these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in\n",

      ">\n",
      "> That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and\n",

      "> and delivered covertly and without warning.\n",
      ">\n",
      "> The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian\n",

      "> development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral\n",

      "> * Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in\n",

      "> is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments,\n",
      "> particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with\n",
      "> ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA\n",

      "> and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for\n",

      "> will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20\n",

      "> to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to\n",
      "> public information efforts that can help people around the world learn\n",
      "> about and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of\n",
      "> civilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization,\n",
      "> a battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas\n",
      "> and this is an area where America must excel.\n",
      ">\n",

      "> a greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas,\n",
      "> and goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish --\n",
      "> our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are\n",
      "> vulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we\n",

The freight still isn't moving, factories are running out of parts, produce is rotting, and retailers are more freaked about Christmas with every passing day. </P><P>\n",
      "On Monday, Bush stepped in and appointed a three-member panel to see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy. (We hope this isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one day to report back.) When Bush gets the report on Tuesday, the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. That would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their Xanax\n",
      "dosages.</P><P>\n",
      "Invoking Taft-Hartley requires a threat to national health or safety -- not the economy. But Labor Secretary Elaine Chao covered that base in a statement on Monday, saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew Iraq would be in here somewhere). \"Union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10-day shutdown,\" said the L.A. Times, but an anonymous Bush administration official \"said that only a portion of\n",
      "what the Defense Department needs has made it ashore.\"</P><P>\n",
      "Politically, this has been a tricky one. Using Taft-Hartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections. On the other hand, \"Voter discontent with Bush's handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the Republican administration,\" said the San Francisco Chronicle. Also, Bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported two-thirds of Americans wanted him to focus more on the\n",
      "economy. \"Though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout, Bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy, andmerited federal intervention,\" said the AP. </P><P>\n",
      "As for Taft-Hartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor disputes. Often the 80-day cooling-off period ends, and workers simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case). One gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers' contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. It's 78 days until Christmas. The race is on. - Jen Muehlbauer</P><P>\n",
