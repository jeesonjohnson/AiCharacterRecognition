# COM2028 -  Aritficial Intelligence CW

As per the cw, we were given 3 tasks to explore differnt AI techniques, we had to first apply OCR on printed text, followed by handwritten text and finally to classify different signature types. 

We also had to create appropriate posters to reflect the results explained from the models, and evaluate the models accordingly. As such the posters are shown below

## Installation

Due to limitations in how much data we can store on GitHub, the repository requires the download of the NIST datasets of handwritten images which needs to be download and extracted into the folder HandWrittenLettersAlignmentFixed.

Which can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format)
